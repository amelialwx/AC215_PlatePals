### Project Description ###

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning application that accurately identifies the types of food present in a user-uploaded image. Based on the foods identified, the application will provide the user with relevant nutritional information and personalized dietary recommendations. This project will involve key phases of data preprocessing, model development, and application interface development, leveraging TensorFlow's Food-101 dataset.

We'll predominantly employ TensorFlow's Food-101 dataset, featuring 101,000 annotated food images across 101 categories. Additionally, we will correlate the identified food items with nutritional metrics obtained from Kaggle's Nutrition datasets and a database called Nutritional Facts for Most Common Foods, which together offer around 9,000 nutritional records. Our dataset is securely hosted in a private Google Cloud Bucket.

**Recap of Milestone 2**

In milestone 2, we provide a container that pulls data from the TensorFlow [Food-101 dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/food101), performs train-validation-test split of 75%, 10%, and 15% respsectively, and uploads the files onto our remote GCS bucket as zip files. 

**Recap of Milestone 3**

In this milestone, we provide a container to read our training, validation, and testing dataset from our remote GCS bucket, fit a CNN model to called EfficientNetV2B0 through a custom job sent to [GCP Vertex AI](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/training/custom-jobs) and model dashboard set up through [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/).

**Milestone 4**

In this milestone, we distilled our CNN model called EfficientNetV2B0 and provided performance benchmarks and analysis. Furthermore, we documented the successful integration of Vertex AI Pipelines (Kubeflow) for machine learning orchestration and cloud functions for process automation.

Preprocess container (Milestone 2)
------------
- This container ingests 4.65GB of the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/food101) and performs image preprocessing before uploading the modified data to a GCS Bucket.
- It also fetches and uploads [nutritional data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prasertcbs/basic-dataset/master/nutrients.csv) as a CSV file to the same GCS Bucket.
- Required inputs: GCS Project Name and GCS Bucket Name.
- Output: Processed data stored in the GCS Bucket.

(1) `src/preprocessing/preprocess.py`: This file manages the preprocessing of our 4.65GB dataset. Image dimensions are resized to 128x128 pixels to expedite subsequent processing. We apply random transformations such as horizontal flips, rotations, and zooms. These preprocessed images are batch-processed and uploaded to the GCS Bucket as a zip file.

(2) `src/preprocessing/requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages essential for image preprocessing.

(3) `src/preprocessing/Dockerfile`: The Dockerfile is configured to use `python:3.9-slim-buster`. It sets up volumes and uses secret keys (which should not be uploaded to GitHub) for connecting to the GCS Bucket.

Model Training a Multi-Class CNN Model (Milestone 3)
------------
- This container reads 4.65GB of the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/food101) from a GCS Bucket that we populated in the `Preprocess container` section.
- It fits and tests EfficientNetV2B0, a CNN model, using the train-val-test split we created in in the `Preprocess container` section to our problem of classifying food images into the 101 labels. 
- The code to perform the the tasks is written in `task.py`.
- The code is sent to GCP Vertex AI to run.
- Our model is connected to Weights and Biases, so we are able to view the model's performance and metrics at every epoch in its training and testing.
- Required inputs: GCS Project Name, GCS Bucket Name (data), GCS Bucket Name (model code), and WandB key.
- Output: Model output in Weights and Biases and Vertex AI

(1) `src/model-training/package/trainer/task.py`: This file reads our food data, a 4.65GB dataset, from the GCS bucket, fits a CNN model for multi-class classification, and then evaluates in on a test dataset. Image dimensions are resized to 128x128 pixels.

Results
------------
**Experiment Tracking**

Below you can see the output from our Weights & Biases page. We used this tool to track several iterations of our model training when it trained our EfficientNet. It was tracked using the `wandb` library we included inside of our `task.py` script. Below is a screenshot of one iteration that we performed with EfficientNetV2B0 for 3 epochs.

**Serverless Training**

Inside our training container, we sent our training job to GCP Vertex AI so it is trained on instances in the cloud, which was how we connected to the Weights & Biases in the previous image above. In the image below, you can see several runs of our model. We had a successful completion of the custom job.

Discussion Regarding Tools Used
------------
1. **Label Studio**: In our project, the image data is already pre-organized and labeled through a folder-based hierarchy, where each folder name serves as the label for the images contained within it. This structure effectively eliminates the need for a separate labeling tool like Label Studio. Therefore, we have opted not to incorporate Label Studio into our existing data pipeline.

2. **Dask**: In our project, the dataset size is well below the 5GB threshold where distributed computing frameworks like Dask would typically be beneficial.  In this context, the overhead of utilizing Dask outweighs the benefits, making it an overkill solution for our particular use case. Therefore, we have chosen not to integrate Dask into our project's data processing workflow

3. **Remote Data and DVC Integration**: In a previous milestone, we encountered difficulties in integrating DVC into our project due to our dataset being stored remotely in a GCS Bucket. Our initial challenges stemmed from the fact that the in-class examples were tailored for locally-stored data, making our remote setup a complicating factor. However, with the guidance and code provided by the course staff, we were able to successfully adapt the DVC workflow to accommodate our remote storage setup. 

4. **TF Data and TF Records**: Our project employs TensorFlow's tf.data and TFRecords as part of our data pipeline, specifically to facilitate efficient and scalable training of our image classification model based on EfficientNetV2B0. TFRecords offer a compact binary storage format, which is optimized for TensorFlow, allowing for rapid data loading. Coupled with the tf.data, it enables us to create highly performant input pipelines, thereby reducing I/O bottlenecks. By leveraging tf.data and TFRecords, we are able to ensure that the data feeding process doesn't become a bottleneck.

5. **EfficientNetV2B0**: EfficientNetV2B0 is an evolution of the original EfficientNet architecture, designed for both improved accuracy and computational efficiency in the context of image classification tasks. According to [this study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00298), the EfficientNetV2 models train faster while being up to 6.8x smaller. These enhancements make EfficientNetV2B0 an attractive choice for our project, as it allows us to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while also maintaining computational efficiency, a key factor given the resource constraints that are often present in real-world machine learning projects.
